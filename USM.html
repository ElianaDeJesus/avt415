  <h3>Scenario</h3>


  <p>Lena Martinez is a heartbroken girl who just got cheated on by her ex boyfriend. She wanted revenge, so she called her best friend. Her best friend remembered a shop she ordered from that deals in magical items. Lena then went onto the website and searches for the "forbidden" magical items. She signs the waiver and orders a revenge of the heart potion to use on her ex. It is scheduled to arrive in 5 days after Lena gets through the place order screen. It worked so well that Lena went onto the Amore website and left a five star review and ordered a heart repair kit for her broken heart.</p>
